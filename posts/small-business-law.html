          Running a small business is an exciting venture, but it comes with its
          fair share of challenges, especially when it comes to navigating legal
          matters. Many entrepreneurs focus on building their brand and
          increasing sales but often overlook crucial legal considerations.
          Unfortunately, even minor oversights can lead to significant financial
          losses or legal disputes. To help you avoid these pitfalls, here are
          some of the most common legal mistakes small businesses make and
          practical tips to prevent them.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Why It’s a Mistake:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A sole proprietorship doesn’t provide liability protection, meaning
            your personal assets could be at risk if your business faces a
            lawsuit.
          </li>
          <li>Incorrect structuring can also lead to higher tax burdens.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How to Avoid It:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Research the pros and cons of different business structures like
            sole proprietorship, LLC, partnership, and corporation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consult with a lawyer or accountant to determine which structure
            aligns with your goals, liability concerns, and tax planning.

          </li>
          <li>
            Missing critical terms, such as payment timelines or confidentiality
            clauses, can leave your business exposed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How to Avoid It:</strong></p>
