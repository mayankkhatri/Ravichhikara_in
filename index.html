              Welcome to my professional space! I am an advocate based in North
              Delhi, specializing in a diverse range of legal areas, including
              Real Estate, Criminal Law, Economic Offences, Service Law,
              Arbitrations, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, Labor Law, and more.
              My extensive experience allows me to navigate the complexities of
              both civil and criminal matters effectively, ensuring that my
              clients receive the highest standard of legal representation.

        <div class="about-card">
          <p>
            Throughout my career, I have successfully represented clients before
            the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the Delhi High Court, and various
            tribunals across Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab. My commitment to
            ensuring justice for all drives my work, and I take pride in
            advocating for my clients' rights and interests with diligence and
            integrity.
            <br />
            <br />
            Beyond my legal practice, I am passionate about raising awareness on
            critical issues, particularly in the realm of animal rights. I
            believe in using my platform to advocate for those who cannot speak
            for themselves. Whether in the courtroom or through my written work,
            I strive to make a positive impact on society.
